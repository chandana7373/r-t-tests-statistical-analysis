Statistical analysis using t-tests in R to examine salary differences and the impact of meditation on sleep quality.

# Statistical Analysis Using T-Tests in R

## Overview
This project applies hypothesis testing techniques using R to analyze real-world datasets. The focus is on conducting appropriate t-tests, interpreting results, and communicating statistical findings clearly.

## Objectives
- Compare salary differences between male and female employees using a two-sample t-test
- Evaluate the impact of meditation on sleep quality using a paired t-test
- Apply statistical reasoning to justify test selection and conclusions

## Tools & Technologies
- R
- RStudio
- MASS package
- t.test function
- Data visualization using base R

## Key Analyses
- Welch two-sample t-test for unequal variances
- Paired t-test for pre- and post-intervention data
- Hypothesis testing at different significance levels (α = 0.05 and 0.10)

## Structure
- `analysis_report.Rmd`: Complete report with code, output, graphs, and interpretation
- `scripts/`: R scripts used for analysis
- `data/`: Dataset used in the project
